This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon SQL error related to NULL value handling in comparison operators. The `bug.sql` file shows a query that unexpectedly excludes rows with NULL values in the comparison. The `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected query, handling NULL values appropriately.  This showcases the importance of careful NULL handling in SQL queries to ensure accurate results.
